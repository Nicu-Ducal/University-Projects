# Tema 2 - Lambda-NFA conversion to Minimal DFA

Python implementation of Lambda-NFA conversion to NFA, NFA to DFA, DFA to minimal DFA + acceptance testing, using functions, classes, dictionaries etc.
Added some text files for inputs of automatas (good to know: if you enter a DFA, NFA, minDFA, you should convert it through all the stepts above, because it will be inputed as an Lambda-NFA).
